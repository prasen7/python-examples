## tuples- ordered and immutable collection of data
# create a one element tuple
myTup1 = 1,
#
tup = 1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 7, 2, 8, 9
# count() method to find the number of duplicates of 2 in the following tuple.
duplicates = tup.count(2)

print(duplicates)    # outputs: 4
#
#
tup1 = 1, 2, 3
a, b, c = tup1

print(a * b * c) # outputs 6.
# The tup1 tuple elements have been "unpacked" in the a, b, and c variables.
